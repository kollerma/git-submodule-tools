 Check for a remote tracking branch

 This command checks whether the repository is on a remote tracking
 branch. Otherwise an error is raised.
 Does not raise an error if the repository is in detached HEAD mode 
 and there are no new commits.

 Usage:
    git check-branch
EOF
    exit 0;
fi

if ! git symbolic-ref -q HEAD > /dev/null ; then
    ## detached head cannot be remote tracking branch...
    ## ...but: if there are no new commits, we can safely ignore this
    ## FIXME: this test only succeed if the new commit is actually
    ##        checked out
    if ! git diff origin...  --quiet; then
	cat 2>&1 <<EOF
Error in $PWD:
 Detached head and new commits. Attach the HEAD by creating
 a new branch or risk losing the commits.
EOF
	exit 1
    fi
cat<<EOF
Warning in $PWD:
 Detached head. This probably just mean that there are updates available
 that are not yet used. To update to the most recent version, use 
   git checkout <branchname> 
 To list all branches, use 
   git branch -a 
 Alternatively try to use "git attach-head" or "git rpull" to update submodule.
